# <TRELLIS>

Welcome to the Trellis frontend repository! Trellis is a plant care platform that helps plant enthusiasts create and manage a thriving indoor garden. Our platform provides users with a comprehensive list of plants to choose from, along with a shop link for easy purchase. With our digital garden, users can save their plants, set a watering schedule, keep track of their progress, and even track the weather and sun's location to ensure their plants are in the best conditions.

The Trellis frontend is built with React.js, utilizing the power of state management with useState and data fetching with useEffect. Our user interface is designed to be both practical and aesthetically pleasing, providing a seamless and efficient experience for all plant enthusiasts.
